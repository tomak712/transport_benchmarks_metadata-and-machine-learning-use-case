# Machine Learning Use Case

This is the bulk of the project. These files allow a user to create, train, and test a neural network against certain test cases for the transport equation.

For the best overview of project results, use "plane_IC_testing.ipynb" with the "plane_IC_model.hdf5" and unseen data "plane_IC_test.hdf5" and "plane_IC_test_conditions.hdf5".
