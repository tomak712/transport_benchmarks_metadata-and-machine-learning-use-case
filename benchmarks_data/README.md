These files provide data and models that have been produced and trained in this project.

The most comprehensive data files in terms of varaition of initial conditons and amount of data included can be found in "plane_IC5.hdf5" and "plane_IC_conditions5.hdf5". And for the square_IC function in in "square_IC2.hdf5" and "square_IC_conditons2.hdf5"

For an introduction to this project and for the best fit model, the student reccomends using "plane_IC_test.hdf5" and "plane_IC_test_conditions.hdf5" to examine the accuracy of "plane_IC_model.hdf5" which was trained on data of similar ranges in the "plane_IC_testing.ipynb" file.
