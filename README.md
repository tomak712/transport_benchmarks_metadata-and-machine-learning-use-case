# Metadata Development and Machine Learning Use Case
by: Thomas King

This project seeks to examine the usage of machine learning to provide quick and reliable solutions to varieites of the transport equation. For a brief overview of the project goals and results, please see the written report. 

The data produced relies on a slightly modified version of [William Bennet's Transport Benchmarks](https://github.com/wbennett39/transport_benchmarks), specifically for the plane_IC function with some cases produced for the square_IC funciton. 

This project was sponsored by the University of Notre Dame's Slatt Fellowship Program for the education of undergraduate student, Thomas King.
